  <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew.</h1>

  <p>
    I work as an Interaction Design Lead on the UX team at Regions Bank.
    Currently, Iâ€™m focusing my efforts on enterprise-wide design initiatives and
    design team operations from my home office in Cookeville, TN.
  </p>

  <p>
    I bring senior-level UX/UI design direction while also executing accessible
    HTML and modern CSS. I love learning new things, and right now Iâ€™m
    practicing design team management and improving my JavaScript skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah
    College of Art and Design while gaining real-world work experience at CNN
    and Turner Broadcasting. In my free time, I enjoy creative activities like
    playing guitar, sewing, and photography.
