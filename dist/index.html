        <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew.</h1>

        <p>
            I work as a Senior UX Engineer at Regions Bank. Currently, I’m focusing my efforts on enterprise-wide design initiatives from my home office in Cookeville, TN.

        <p>
            I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah College of Art and Design while gaining real-world work experience at CNN and Turner Broadcasting. In my free time, I enjoy creative activities like playing guitar, sewing, and photography.
