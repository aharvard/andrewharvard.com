  <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew.</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a full-stack designer with frontend web development experience. I've
    been practicing UX and interaction design for over 8 years â€” 4 of those
    being remote. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between designers and
    developers and have helped companies establish and manage design systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah
    College of Art and Design while gaining real-world work experience at CNN
    and Turner Broadcasting. In my free time, I enjoy creative activities like
    playing guitar, restoring old furniture, taking photographs, and traveling
    around the country.
