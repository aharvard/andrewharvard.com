  <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew.</h1>

  <p>
    As a designer/developer hybrid, I'm looking for a new opportunities that
    allows me to balance my design experience with passion for engineering user
    interfacesâ€”also open to roles that may focus solely on design or
    development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I bring senior-level UX/UI design direction while also executing accessible
    HTML and modern CSS, with a sharp eye for typography, spacing, and color.
    Currently, I'm honing my vanilla JavaScript skills and I really enjoy
    working in the JAM stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah
    College of Art and Design while gaining real-world work experience at CNN
    and Turner Broadcasting. In my free time, I enjoy creative activities like
    playing guitar, sewing, and photography.
  </p>
