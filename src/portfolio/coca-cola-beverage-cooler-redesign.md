Coca-Cola sponsored my senior-year capstone industrial design group project at Georgia Tech. As one of two designers, plus two mechanical engineers, we were tasked with discovering innovation opportunities for end-cap coolers. We met regularly with the team at Coca-Cola throughout the semester to get feedback. I was responsible for our visual design language and digital experience.
