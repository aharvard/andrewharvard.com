# Hi, I'm Andrew.

I work as a Senior UX Engineer at Regions Bank, and **Black lives matter**.

Currently, I'm developing UIs for the bank's public-facing websites, consulting on UI systems architecture, and refining front-end build tooling.

I enjoy writing modern CSS and designing accessible HTML patterns. I believe that design is a team sport, and I love working with designers, content strategists, researchers, and architects.

In 2011, I got my start in UX as a designer and enjoyed being a generalist. Over the past few years, I began to specialize in interaction design and UI development.

I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah College of Art and Design. During that time, I gained work experience at CNN and Turner Broadcasting.

I work from my home office in Cookeville, TN and I'm a proud cat dad to Davy, Johnny, and Walter.
