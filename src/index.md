I work as a Senior UX Engineer at Regions Bank. Currently, I'm developing an enterprise design system, consulting on UI systems architecture, and refining front-end build tooling.

I enjoy coding modern CSS and designing accessible HTML patterns. I believe that design is a team sport, and I love working with designers, content strategists, researchers, architects, and product folks.

I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah College of Art and Design. During that time, I gained work experience at CNN and Turner Broadcasting.

In 2011, I started as a UX Designer, and since 2015, I've specialized in web development and interaction design.

I work remotely from my home office in Cookeville, TN, and I'm a proud cat dad to Davy, Johnny, and Walter.
