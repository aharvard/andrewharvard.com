I work as a Senior UX Engineer at Regions Bank. Currently, I'm developing UIs for the bank's websites, consulting on front-end systems architecture, and implementing an enterprise-wide design system.

I enjoy writing modern CSS and designing accessible HTML patterns. I believe that design is a team sport, and I love working with designers, content strategists, researchers, and architects.

In 2011, I got my start in UX as a designer and enjoyed being a generalist. Since 2015, I've specialized in interaction design and UI development.

I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah College of Art and Design. During that time, I gained work experience at CNN and Turner Broadcasting.

I work from my home office in Charlotte, NC and I'm a proud cat dad to Davy, Johnny, and Walter.
