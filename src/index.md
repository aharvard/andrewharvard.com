I work at Monster as a Principal UX Engineer, focusing on design systems, prototyping, and front-end architecture.

I'm happiest working at the intersection of design and engineering while collaborating on a cross-functional team. I enjoy designing in Figma, writing modern CSS, crafting accessible HTML, and coding in TypeScript. Occasionally, I tinker around on CodePen; check out [some of my pens](https://codepen.io/aharvard)!

In 2011, I started my career in UX as a generalist designer. Since 2015, I've specialized in design systems and front-end development.

I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah College of Art and Design. During that time, I gained work experience at CNN and Turner Broadcasting.

I work from my home office in Charlotte, NC, and I'm a proud cat dad to Davy, Johnny, and Walter.
