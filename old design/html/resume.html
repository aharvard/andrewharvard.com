    <h1>EMPLOYMENT</h1>

          <div class="first-line">
          <p class="role">Interaction Designer</p>
          <p class="company">Regions Bank</p>
          <p class="city">Birmingham, AL</p>
          <p class="year">2016 – PRESENT</p></div>
          <p class="description">I already had nearly four years of experience serving Regions Bank as my client at Intuitive Company when I accepted my current position on the bank's customer experience and innovation team.  My role is to design experiences for the bank's customers across a variety of digital platforms, and I'm responsible for overseeing the design and development of new features on the bank's primary public-facing website.  Other tasks include managing vendor relationships, advocating for the adoption of industry best practices, and fostering a culture of enthusiasm for good design.  As a remote employee I enjoy working from my home office near Atlanta and regularly travel to Birmingham for team meetings. </p>

          <p class="description">As an on-site contractor at Southern Company, I designed user experiences and developed responsive, enterprise-level web applications. One project involved working on an agile team to build a new version of Georgia Power’s Land Information Management System while others involved defining future features for business stakeholders, designing user interface elements, and coding CSS and HTML. I also consulted on the re-design of customer bill-pay experiences, defined front-end web development standards for the IT department, and provided design support for developers. In all of my efforts, I focused on delivering scalable, atomic designs that make enterprise-level web development efficient and enjoyable.</p>

In other roles, I focused on public speaking, design competitions, digital prototyping, and business development. I directed design strategies and led cross-disciplinary teams. I regularly attended client meetings in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Birmingham, and Charlotte, and worked as a remote employee for the last year of my tenure.</p>
