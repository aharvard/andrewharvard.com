    <p class="blurb">My name is Andrew, and I’m currently employed as an interaction designer at <a href="https://www.regions.com/personal-banking/" target="_blank">Regions Bank</a> where I have the privilege of working remotely from my home office near Atlanta. My responsibilities include leading design projects and managing work efforts for an interdisciplinary team.  I also do graphic, visual, and motion design work as well as front end web development on the side.
    <br><br>
    I studied industrial design at Georgia Tech and typography at Savannah College of Art and Design while gaining real-world work experience at CNN and Turner Broadcasting. Since then I’ve completed a variety of projects for prominent financial institutions, local small businesses, non-profits, and friends.<!-- , and these days I’m designing and developing enterprise-level web applications while getting involved with team leadership and public-speaking. -->
    <br><br>
    I’ve created everything from company logos and WordPress websites to wedding invitations and wooden cabinets, and in my free time I enjoy similarly creative activities like playing guitar, restoring old furniture, taking photographs, and traveling around the country. View my <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> and <a href="/resume.html">resume</a> to learn more about my work and <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> if you’d like to talk—I’m always interested in making <br> new connections!</p>
